# Discussion 1 - CMSC330 Fall 2019

## Administrative/Announcements

1. Welcome to CMSC330!

2. This class is about learning different programming paradigms. You will be introduced to Ruby, OCaml and Rust. Over the duration of the class, you will come to realize that this class is not so much about learning these 3 languages as it is about learning *when* to use them, what their strengths/weaknesses are, and the history behind their making. In addition to learning programming languages, about half the semester will be devoted to concepts about how languages work - how those letters you type on your screen turn into machine code. We will go over automatons, tokenizing, parsing, lambda calculus and such.

3. Tips for getting a good grade in 330:
  * Start projects early! 40% of your grade is projects. Some individual projects may be worth as much as 8%, which means if you get 50/100 on the project, you're already losing half a letter grade! Conversely, you can excel at projects and really boost your grade.
  * Use previous quizzes and exams. They're highly representative of all the quizzes and exams we'll have this semester. They can be found on the course website.
  * Come to class and discussion. We'll be showing some really cool examples.
  * Please ask us conceptual questions in office hours. TAs love getting questions like "I don't understand X, could you clarify it for me please?".

4. You may attend any discussion if you oversleep, have an interview etc. On quiz days, however, you MUST notify both your own TA and the TA whose discussion you will be attending, and must have very good reason to attend a different section.

5. Often, students run into similar problems, or have similar questions. Make sure to check Piazza before coming to office hours for answers to your questions. Use the Piazza search bar before posting a new question.

6. Project 1 is up and is due on the 10th of September.

7. You should all be done with Project 0 by now. Use c9.io or Grace for now if you haven't done it already but you MUST finish it over the weekend.
